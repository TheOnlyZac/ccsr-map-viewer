# Cartoon Cartoon Summer Resort Map Viewer

This is a work-in-progress map viewer for the Cartoon Cartoon Summer Resort series. The games were made with Adobe Shockwave and published in the summer of 2000 on Cartoon Network's website.

## Instructions
Run the script <code>viewer.py</code> to start the viewer. Use the **arrow keys** to move between maps, and press **G** to show/hide the tile grid.

You can also pass the name of a file as a commandline argument to open that specific map, but you will not be able to scroll with the arrow keys.

## Notes
The map data files from Episode 1 can be found in the <code>maps/episode1</code> folder. It will also work with maps from other episodes (if you have them), but it currently only has the tileset from Episode 1.
