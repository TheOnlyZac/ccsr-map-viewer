# Cartoon Cartoon Summer Resort Map Viewer

This is a work-in-progress map viewer for the Cartoon Cartoon Summer Resort series. The games were made with Adobe Shockwave and published in the summer of 2000 to promote Cartoon Network's <i>Cartoon Cartoon Summer</i> programming block.

Open a command prompt and use <code>python viewer.py [filename]</code> to open a map data file. Map files from Episode 1 can be found in the <code>maps/episode1</code> folder. It will also work with maps from other episodes (if you have them), but it currently only has the tileset from Episode 1.
